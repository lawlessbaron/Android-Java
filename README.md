######Documentation
The documentation will be added in due time.

######JavaDocs
With the work that i have done i will try to include the Java Doc, if you are not sure of Java Doc it is a function within Java where you can comment code or such with special comments in which you can then generate a document explaining different functions, methods, classes and imports anything that has a purpose in the code can be put into javadoc
